[01:00.19] Holding back the years
[01:05.84] Thinking of the fear I've had so long
[01:10.91] When somebody hears
[01:16.92] Listen to the fear that's gone
[01:31.92] 
[01:25.30] Strangled by the wishes of pater
[01:30.72] Hoping for the arms of mater
[01:36.53] Get to neither sooner or later
[01:51.53] 
[01:55.91] Holding back the years
[02:01.44] Chance for me to escape from all I know
[02:07.16] Holding back the tears
[02:12.20] 'Cause nothing here has grown
[02:26.70] 
[02:20.82] I've wasted all my tears
[02:26.52] Wasted all those years
[02:32.05] Nothing had the chance to be good
[02:37.62] Nothing ever could, yeah
[02:49.62] 
[02:45.26] I'll keep holding on
[02:50.90] I'll keep holding on
[02:56.39] I'll keep holding on
[03:02.05] I'll keep holding on
[03:09.38] So tired
[03:13.38] 
[03:27.99] Well, I've wasted all my tears
[03:35.85] Wasted all those years
[03:41.34] And nothing had the chance to be good
[03:46.94] 'Cause nothing ever could, oh yeah
[03:52.64] Oh
[03:53.64] 
[03:54.84] I'll keep holding on
[04:00.58] I'll keep holding on
[04:06.05] I'll keep holding on
[04:11.51] I'll keep holding on
[04:16.27] Holdin', holdin', holdin', holdin' all my life
[04:39.27] 
[04:26.82] I said, "Ooh, yeah"
[04:33.83] That's all I have today
[04:39.55] It's all I have to say
[04:44.96] That's all I have today
[04:50.77] It's all I have to say
